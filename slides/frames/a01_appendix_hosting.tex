    \frametitle{Appendix: Hosting}

    Now that we've built a basic website, we need somewhere to host it so that it is accessible on the public internet.
    There are two steps to this process:

    \smallskip

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Choosing a domain name (e.g., example.org)
        \item Choosing a hosting service
    \end{enumerate}

    \medskip
    Choosing a hosting service is outside the scope of this workshop, but some good places to start are:

    \smallskip

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.bluehost.com/}{Bluehost}
        \item \href{https://www.namecheap.com}{Namecheap}
        \item \href{https://www.hostgator.com/}{HostGator}
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill

    Each of these services provide both domain registration and website hosting services.
