    At this point, we have created a basic website with Hugo by creating several Markdown pages. We now need to convert
    these files into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that our website can be hosted on the public internet.

    \bigskip

    To do so, we simply run the following from our terminal:

    \smallskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8]
        $ ./hugo
    \end{lstlisting}

    \bigskip
    Our compiled websites files can then be found in the \texttt{public} folder in our project directory.
