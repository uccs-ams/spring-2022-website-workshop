    Building a website from scratch is a bit like building a PDF document from scratch:

    \bigskip

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \setlength\itemsep{2em}
        \item Doing so provides the most flexibility, but is also excessive for most purposes.
        \item There exist tools to create websites visually, but these tools tend to be specialized and difficult to
              collaborate with.
        \item For our purposes, we often care more about content than we do about customization.
    \end{itemize}
