    \frametitle{Website Scaffolding}

    Basic information about our website (title, theme, website URL, etc.) is contained in the \texttt{config.toml} 
    configuration file inside the \texttt{website-workshop} folder on our Desktop. 
    
    \medskip

    Let's open that file with a text editor and replace the existing content with the following to enable the
    \texttt{researcher} Hugo theme:

    \bigskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8,title={config.toml},numbers=left]
        baseURL = "http://example.org/" # If you have your own domain name, add it here.
        title = "Mathy McMathFace"
        theme = "researcher"
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vfill

    We're going to add quite a few more things to this file before we're done.
