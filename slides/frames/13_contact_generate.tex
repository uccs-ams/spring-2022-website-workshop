    \frametitle{Contact Page}

    Now that the world knows who we are, let's create a contact page so that they know how to reach us.
    Like before, we'll use Hugo to generate a new page:

    \medskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=6]
      ./hugo new contact.md
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vfill

    We also need to add a link to this page from our index page. We can add links to pages by modifying our 
    \texttt{config.toml} configuration file, just like we did before for our resume:

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=6,title={config.toml},numbers=left,firstnumber=7]
      ...
      [menu]
        [[menu.main]]
          name = "Resume"
          url = "/resume.pdf"
          weight = 1
        [[menu.main]]
          name = "Contact"
          url = "/contact"
          weight = 2
    \end{lstlisting}
