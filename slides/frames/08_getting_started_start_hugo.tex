    \frametitle{Start Hugo}

    We're finally ready to build our website! We first need to start our Hugo server, which lets us see our website
    in a browser and rebuilds the site automatically whenever we modify any project files:

    \bigskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8]
        $ ./hugo -D serve
    \end{lstlisting}

    \bigskip

    After running this command, we can see our website by navigating to \url{http://localhost:1313/} in a web
    browser. It'll be blank for now, but we're about to fix that.
