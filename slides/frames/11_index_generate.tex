    \frametitle{Main Page}

    Our \textbf{index} (main) page is looking pretty barren - let's change that! Our first task is to create a new 
    Markdown file for Hugo to turn into a webpage, and we'll use Hugo to do so.    

    \smallskip

    Open a new terminal, and then run the following command to navigate to our project directory:

    \medskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8]
        $ cd Desktop/website-workshop
    \end{lstlisting}

    \vfill

    From here, we'll instruct Hugo to generate a new Markdown file for us to modify:\footnote{
      The \texttt{\_index.md} file name holds special significance in Hugo projects; the contents of this file are
      rendered to the main page.
    }

    \medskip

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8]
        $ ./hugo new _index.md
    \end{lstlisting}

    \smallskip

    This command generates a new Markdown file at \texttt{website-workshop/content/\_index.md}.
