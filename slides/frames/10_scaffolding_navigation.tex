    Now we'll add a footer and a link to our CV to our website by adding a handful of lines to our \texttt{config.toml} 
    file.\footnote{
      The file we're linking to in this workshop can be found in our project folder at \texttt{content/cv.pdf}.
    } 

    \bigskip
    
    Be sure to pay attention to spacing!

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=saneCode,gobble=8,title={config.toml},numbers=left,firstnumber=4]
        
        [params]
          [params.footer]
            text = 'Copyright 2022 Mathy McMathFace'
        
        [menu]
          [[menu.main]]
            name = "Curriculum Vitae"
            url = "/cv.pdf"
            weight = 1
    \end{lstlisting}

    Let's see what our website looks like so far.
