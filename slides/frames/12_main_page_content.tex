        &nbsp;
        **Mathy McMathface** is currently a graduate student studying Mathematics
        at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) and is an officer for
        the American Mathematical Society Graduate Student Chapter at UCCS. Their
        research interests include inverse reactive currents for use in unilateral
